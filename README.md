# About Me
Hi, I'm SJ! (aka CirroArch) I am an IT professional, social worker, and artist. I love learning about technology. Follow me on my tech journey! I have broad interests in cloud engineering, information security, DevOps, and web development. My interests expand with each new technology I learn about.

# Why "CirroArch"?
It's a fun combination of the Latin word for "curly" to reference my natural hairstyle and the word "arch" - short for "architect". Curly, cloud security architect - that's me!

# Projects
- [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/CirroArch/cloud-resume-challenge):
 This project requires me to build a resume website, host it in the cloud, and create a functional serverless API, using Infrastructure as Code and a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment. I am using Azure as the cloud provider for this project. I also plan to complete future versions of this project using Kubernetes and Terraform. The challenge gives practical experience in front-end and back-end development, serverless architectures, security, and version control.
